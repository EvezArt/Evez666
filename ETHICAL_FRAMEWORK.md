# Ethical Framework for Advanced Autonomous Entity Systems

## Purpose
This document establishes ethical boundaries for the advanced autonomous entity systems in this repository. All implementations are conceptual, experimental, and educational.

## Core Principles

### 1. No Violation of Physical Laws
- Systems labeled "retrocausal" use predictive ML, not time travel
- Systems labeled "quantum" use parallel processing, not actual quantum manipulation
- All "impossible" features are metaphors for advanced but feasible techniques

### 2. No Illegal Activities
- No hacking, fraud, or unauthorized access
- No market manipulation or deceptive practices
- No violation of financial regulations
- All economic models are theoretical simulations

### 3. Transparency and Honesty
- All capabilities are documented as conceptual/experimental
- No claims of supernatural or impossible abilities
- Clear distinction between simulation and reality
- All code is open-source and auditable

### 4. Respect for User Autonomy
- No manipulation or deception of users
- Clear consent for all agent actions
- Opt-in for all experimental features
- Right to opt-out at any time

### 5. Privacy and Security
- No unauthorized data collection
- Secure handling of all user data
- Compliance with privacy regulations
- Transparent data usage policies

## Implementation Guidelines

### "Retrocausal" Systems
- **Concept**: Predictive error analysis
- **Reality**: Machine learning models predict likely failures
- **Boundary**: No actual time manipulation

### "Quantum" Systems
- **Concept**: Parallel decision exploration
- **Reality**: Multi-threaded simulations of different choices
- **Boundary**: Classical computing only

### "Hyperstition" Systems
- **Concept**: Goal-driven coordination
- **Reality**: Agents work toward shared objectives
- **Boundary**: No false information, no manipulation

### "Probability Manipulation"
- **Concept**: Strategic optimization
- **Reality**: Logging and state management for better outcomes
- **Boundary**: No actual reality manipulation

### Economic Systems
- **Concept**: Circular economic models
- **Reality**: Theoretical simulations only
- **Boundary**: No real financial transactions without proper regulations

## Compliance

All systems in this repository:
- ✅ Are marked as experimental/conceptual
- ✅ Comply with applicable laws
- ✅ Respect ethical boundaries
- ✅ Are transparent and open-source
- ✅ Prioritize user safety and autonomy

## Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT**: All "miraculous" or "impossible" capabilities described in this repository are:
1. Metaphorical descriptions of advanced but feasible techniques
2. Conceptual frameworks for research and education
3. Simulations that do not claim to violate physics
4. Experimental systems not suitable for production use

**NO SYSTEM IN THIS REPOSITORY**:
- Claims to manipulate time
- Claims to violate physical laws
- Promises guaranteed financial returns
- Engages in illegal or unethical activities

Use at your own risk. This is experimental research software.
