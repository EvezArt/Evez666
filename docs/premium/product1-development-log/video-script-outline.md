## Chapter 1 Walkthrough (3:00 - 6:00)

**[Screen: Open Chapter 1 markdown]**

"Let's start with Chapter 1: Initial Vision & Concept. 

This chapter shows the actual conversation where we defined what a cognitive engine should do. You'll see:
- The original problem statement
- Decision points on architecture
- Why we chose certain technologies
- How we planned the implementation

[Scroll through chapter]

Notice how each section includes the reasoning behind decisions. This isn't just 'what' we built, but 'why' we made each choice."

## Code Examples Demo (6:00 - 9:00)

**[Screen: Open code-examples directory]**

"Now let's look at the working code examples.

[Open github-workflow-example.yml]

This is an actual GitHub Actions workflow used in the project. You can copy this directly into your repository and modify it for your needs.

[Open extraction-script.py]

Here's the Python script for content extraction. Let me run this...

[Run script in terminal]

See how it extracts and processes content? You can adapt this for your own data sources."

---

## Interactive Notebook (9:00 - 13:00)

**[Screen: Open Jupyter notebook]**

"One of the most valuable parts is the interactive notebook.

[Run Jupyter]

Let me show you the LORD Protocol visualization...

[Execute cell with Divine Gap calculation]

This shows the mathematical foundation of the cognitive engine. You can modify these parameters and see the results immediately.

[Modify parameters and re-run]

Try different values to understand how the system behaves under various conditions."

---

## Templates Section (13:00 - 15:00)

**[Screen: Templates directory]**

"The templates give you starting points for your own projects.

[Show issue-template.md]

This issue template is designed for AI-assisted development. Copy it to your .github folder and you'll have structured issues that AI can work with effectively.

[Show product-metadata-template.json]

If you're creating your own digital products, this metadata template helps you organize product information consistently."

## How to Use This Product (15:00 - 18:00)

**[Screen: Split screen with README]**

"Here's my recommended workflow:

1. **First pass**: Read all chapters sequentially to understand the full journey
2. **Deep dive**: Focus on chapters relevant to your current project
3. **Experiment**: Run the Jupyter notebooks with your own parameters
4. **Implement**: Use the templates and code examples in your projects
5. **Reference**: Keep it as a guide when making architectural decisions

The key is to not just read it, but actively use it in your own work."

## Support and Updates (18:00 - 19:00)

**[Screen: Support information]**

"You get 30 days of email support with purchase. If you have questions about implementing something, just reach out.

Free updates for version 1.x are included. As we refine and expand the content, you'll automatically get the improvements."

---

## Closing (19:00 - 20:00)

**[Screen: Revenue projections slide]**

"This product represents real knowledge extracted from actual implementation. Not theory, not speculation - actual working code and decisions.

At $67, you're getting the blueprint for a system that took 24 hours to build and has the potential to generate thousands in revenue.

Thanks for watching. Link to purchase is in the description below."
