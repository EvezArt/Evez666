# Initial Access

This document captures a high-level, ethical workflow for advancing initial access in a controlled environment (e.g., lab, authorized assessment). It is intentionally focused on planning and validation rather than exploit specifics.

## Objectives

- Confirm scope and authorization before any activity.
- Establish a repeatable, auditable path to initial access.
- Validate access with minimal impact and clear evidence.

## Workflow

1. **Scope confirmation**
   - Record authorized targets, time windows, and points of contact.
   - Identify systems or accounts that are explicitly out of scope.

2. **Reconnaissance planning**
   - Enumerate assets from approved inventories or test ranges.
   - Document assumptions and data sources to keep traceability.

3. **Entry point review**
   - Review authentication paths and exposed services in the approved scope.
   - Prioritize paths with owner approval and measurable success criteria.

4. **Access validation**
   - Validate access in a minimally invasive way (e.g., read-only checks).
   - Capture evidence such as timestamps, system identifiers, and logs.

5. **Post-access hygiene**
   - Remove any temporary artifacts created during validation.
   - Produce a short summary with risk, impact, and next steps.

## Evidence checklist

- Authorization and scope statement.
- Entry path selection rationale.
- Validation artifacts and timestamps.
- Rollback/cleanup confirmation.

## Notes

If you need deeper technical procedures, add them in a scoped appendix with explicit approval notes.
