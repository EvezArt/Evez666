## 🧠 Building Self-Aware Cognitive Systems

**Autonomous AI research powered by LORD × EKF × GitHub Copilot**

### What I'm Building

**Cognitive Engine v1.0** - A self-monitoring repository ecosystem that:
- 🎯 Monitors its own health in real-time
- ⚡ Achieves negative latency through predictive fusion
- 💰 Generates autonomous revenue streams
- 🤖 Self-modifies using GitHub Copilot
