"""
Historical/editor backup file for the telemetry module.

This file lives under `.history/` and is not part of the source-of-truth
implementation or the supported public API. It is retained only as an
inert snapshot and should not be imported or modified for runtime use.

The active telemetry implementation should live in the main source tree
(for example, under `src/`), and `.history/` should be excluded from
version control (e.g., via `.gitignore`).
